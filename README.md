I came to realise there are simplier ways to achieving this, just use a simple shell script
with curl and just use cron to schedule the script.  That way you get full control of where you
sources your WAN IP address from.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd "$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null && pwd )"
IP=$(dig -4 +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com)
if [ "$IP" != "$(cat IpAddress/Server)" ]; then
        echo $IP > IpAddress/Server
        curl -X PUT \
        https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/:zone_identifier/dns_records/:identifier \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'X-Auth-Email: name@exmaple.com' \
        -H 'X-Auth-Key: Cloudflare API Key' \
        -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
        -d "{\"type\":\"A\",\"name\":\"example.com\",\"content\":\"$IP\"}"
fi
```

If you want to distribute your IP address file across multiple systems over LAN and WAN, you might want to checkout
https://syncthing.net/ it's awesome; and yes it's written in Go.  You could write your own version in Node, but I
strongly advices against that. ðŸ˜‰

Oh here a neat little trick of using the file with ssh.

```sh
$ ssh -o 'HostKeyAlias myhost' username@$(cat ~/IpAddress/Server)
```

I tested it, it's work wonderfully, make sure you add the alias to `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. ðŸ˜Š
